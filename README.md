Elevator Pitch / Poster | AP Research Block 1.2 2022

Created pursuant to rubrics offered 6th October 2022, posted due 31st October 2022, with relevant charts and arangement for all expectations being granted widely from the first. Therefore am beginning the compositional effort whereby I may bring to bear at such time as the presentation is made - again, at such time after the posted due as Mr. Grange finds it convenient - to render in lieu of a physical poster or presentation along traditional lines - that is, PowerPoint or Slides - a visual composed through Web Design principles.
